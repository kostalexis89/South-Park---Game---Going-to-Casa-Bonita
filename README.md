# South-Park-Game-JvScrpt-HelpEricClearTheStreets

This game has been developed by me 'https://github.com/kostalexis89', regarding an assesmnent while i was studying at Iron Hack / Web Developing Bootcamp.

Its basically structured with Javascript using the P5 library.

i took the Idea from Git Hub, while i found a very similar project by Wispoi. "https://github.com/Wispoi/South-Park-The-Runner-Game"

The artwork is partly from that repository, and part from google / Internet.

I didnt copied any code. The coding is created by me 100%

I dont have any intention of selling this product, it s just made for educational purposes.
